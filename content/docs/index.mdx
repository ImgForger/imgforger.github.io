# Meet Imgforge

**Imgforge** is the high-performance image proxy that sits between your users and your storage. It transforms images on the fly, resizing, cropping, and optimizing them in milliseconds, so you never have to manually resize picture or generate thumbnails again.

Built with **Rust** and **libvips**, it delivers blazing speed and rock-solid security, serving optimized WebP and AVIF images automatically.

## How It Works

Imgforge acts as a smart layer in your stack. Instead of serving heavy originals, your app requests a transformed version. Imgforge processes it instantly, caches the result, and delivers it to the user.

## Forge Image With Imgforge

### 🚀 **Performance First**
Written in **Rust** and built on the asynchronous **Axum** framework, imgforge is designed for low latency and high throughput. It uses **libvips**, which consumes far less memory than standard alternatives like ImageMagick.

### 🛡️ **Secure by Design**
We take security seriously.
- **HMAC Signatures:** Every URL is signed to prevent tampering and denial-of-service attacks.
- **Strict Validation:** Checks file types and dimensions before processing begins.
- **Rate Limiting:** Built-in guards to protect your infrastructure.

### 💾 **Smart Caching**
Why process the same image twice? Imgforge includes **Foyer**, a hybrid caching engine that intelligently manages hot items in memory and warm items on disk.

### ☁️ **Production Ready**
From comprehensive **Prometheus metrics** to structured JSON logs, imgforge gives you full visibility into your image pipeline. It's container-native and ready for Kubernetes.

## Solves Real Problems

| Problem | The Imgforge Solution |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Storage Bloat** | Store only the original high-res image. Generate variants on demand. |
| **Slow Load Times** | Automatically convert JPEGs/PNGs to modern, lightweight **WebP** or **AVIF**. |
| **Complex Pipelines** | Replace brittle Lambda functions and batch jobs with a single, robust binary. |
| **Security Risks** | Prevent "pixel flood" attacks and unverified uploads with signed URLs. |
